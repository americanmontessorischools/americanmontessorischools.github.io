                            <li>We believe in the triangle approach to education where the teacher, the parent and the child form the three vertices of the triangle. To that end we aim at total partnership with our parents to achieve full development of the child.</li>
                            <li>Our goal is to inspire personal and intellectual growth, encourage a deep love for learning, and promote global citizenship.</li>
                            <li>We believe in nurturing independent thinking, creativity and collaboration.</li>
                            <li>We are committed to offering a safe and inspiring environment for our community of students and teachers.</li>
