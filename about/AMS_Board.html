<h3>Pradnya Naidu</h3>
Pradnya Naidu first fell in love with the Montessori method of education when she was researching different types of preschools for her daughter. She believed in overall development by exposing kids to a wide variety of materials. She particularly found the idea of including sewing, cooking along with academics in the daily curriculum to be very exciting for younger kids. As a Montessori parent for over four years, Pradnya was able to witness firsthand the benefits of a Montessori education in different areas of the classroom. She believes in the strong foundation that a Montessori curriculum lays and strongly recommends it to other parents.
