<p>Our Mission is to ignite minds using proven montessori methods. We share Maria's vision as quoted below.</p>
<p>My vision of the future is no longer people taking exams and proceeding then on that certification . . . but of individuals passing from one stage of independence to a higher [one],&nbsp;by means of their own activity through their own effort of will, which constitutes the inner evolution of the individual.</p>
