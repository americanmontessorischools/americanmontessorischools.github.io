				<h3>Welcome to American Montessori School in Hillsborough!</h3>
				<div>
	  				<p style="text-align: justify;font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 1.5em;"><em>&#34;The most important period of life is the period from birth to the age of six. For that is the time when manâ€™s intelligence itself, his greatest implement, is being formed.</em>&#34;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Maria Montessori</p>
				</div>
				<p>
				The greatest investment you can make for your child is to provide her with a strong educational foundation. At American Montessori School, students are given an academic experience that exceeds most traditional settings.
			  </p>
				<p>
				The American Montessori School, conveniently located on U.S. 206, opposite the Duke Farms, and bordering the town of Bridgewater, is a private, non-sectarian Montessori school for children aged 2.5 to 6 years old. The school features fully-equipped classrooms, well-maintained playgrounds and is staffed by trained Montessori teachers.
				</p>
				<p>
				The American Montessori School is licensed by the New Jersey Department of Youth and Family Services and is affiliated with The American Montessori Society, a professional organization that endorses authentic Montessori schools all over the world.
				</p>
				<p>
				Our students come from a wide range of cultural backgrounds and towns including Bridgewater, Hillsborough, Belle Meade and Somerville. Paired with the multi-national American Montessori staff, they create a rich and diverse cultural canvas.
				</p>
				<p>
				At AMS, we believe in developing the whole-child intellectually, socially, emotionally and physically. We are committed to delivering an outstanding experience for your child based on the proven Montessori methodology and the great talents and dedication of our faculty.
				</p>
				<p>
				Our admissions process is designed to help you make that very important decision of choosing a school for your child and your family. You can then make an informed choice whether our school meets your expectations for the education of your child.
