                <h1>Our Primary <strong>Curriculum</strong></h1>
                <p>Our dynamic curriculum is based on core Montessori principles, enhanced by current educational research and includes areas of language, math, science, geography, history, art, music and movement.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Language Arts</strong> includes oral language development, written expression, reading, the study of grammar, creative dramatics, and children's literature. Basic skills in writing and reading are developed through the use of sandpaper letters, alphabet cut-outs, and various presentations allowing children to link sounds and letter symbols effortlessly and to express their thoughts through writing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mathematics</strong> includes number recognition, counting, basic operations of addition, multiplication, subtraction and division, squares and cubes, four-digit numbers and the decimal system. The emphasis is on understanding the concepts as opposed to learning by rote. This is achieved through the use of authentic Montessori materials, that were designed to capture the interest of the learning child.</li>
                        <li><strong>Science</strong> includes classification of objects, learning about the parts of different living things, lifecycles of organisms, the human body, the solar system and also performing hands-on experiments.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cultural</strong> activities expose the child to basics in geography, history, and life sciences.</li>
                        <li><strong>Music, art, and movement</strong> education are part of the integrated cultural curriculum.</li>
                        <li><strong>Practical Life</strong> area is where the child works on activities that help with fine motor skills, which prepare the hand for writing. Also included are independence-building activities like care of self, care of the environment, exercises of grace and courtesy, and coordination of physical movement. Food preparation is a part of the Practical Life curriculum.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sensorial</strong> area enables the child to order, classify, and describe sensory impressions in relation to length, width, temperature, mass, color, pitch, etc. Visual discrimination mastered in this area helps the child to master the nuances of reading, for e.g. to differentiate between the letters d and b.</li>
                        <li><strong>Peace Curriculum</strong> is an integral part of the Montessori education. Children are taught and encouraged to indulge in peaceful activities as they work and play with their friends. Conflict resolution, with the help of a peace rose; singing peace songs and reading books on peace are integrated into the daily activities. Through the course of the year the children will help in the planting and maintenance of our peace garden in the outside play area.</li>
