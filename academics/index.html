<h3>Our Programs</h3>

<h4>The American Montessori School offers the following programs:</h4>

<h4>Stepping Stones Ages 2.5 to 3.5 years</h4>

<p>
Prospective parents interested in enrolling their child in The American Montessori School are encouraged to make an appointment to tour the school prior to submitting an application. You may contact the school at (908) 977-6640 or email info@americanmontessorischools.com to arrange a tour.
If you would prefer to attend an Open House, and there is an upcoming one scheduled, you may RSVP by email. The tours allow the parents an opportunity to discuss with the administrator any questions or concerns they may have.
After your tour, you may fill out an application at the school to reserve your child’s spot.</p>

<h4>Primary Mixed-age Class Ages 3 to 6 years (Includes Kindergarten)</h4>

<p>Children aged 3 to 6 are naturally curious, fast learners. It is the period of maximum learning and the “prepared environment’’ in a Montessori classroom 
is designed for maximum absorption by little minds.</p>

<p>The mixed-age grouping, advocated by Maria Montessori, enables a community feel to the class, with older children serving as role models for the younger friends.</p> 

<p>The primary program is held in the Neil Armstrong classroom, a warm, carpeted space with lots of windows for natural light. Montessori materials are arranged sequentially on the shelves in order of increasing difficulty. The room exits directly into the outside play area.</p> 

<h4>A Typical Day</h4>

<p>A typical day for Primary students begins with an uninterrupted work cycle in which children choose from among a number of age-appropriate activities. Children receive group, as well as individual lessons, through the support and guidance of Montessori certified teachers.</p>

<p>At the end of the morning children either go home or remain for lunch and/or the afternoon Montessori session. The lunch program incorporates setting tables, grace and courtesy, table conversation, and clean-up. The afternoon session continues similar to the morning.</p>

<p>Both morning and afternoon sessions go out on the playground daily (weather permitting), and both have snack.</p>

<p>We strongly encourage parents to visit our school in order to learn about our academic program, our educational philosophy, and our school community and culture.</p>
