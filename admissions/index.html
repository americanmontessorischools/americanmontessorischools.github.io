Prospective parents interested in enrolling their child in The American Montessori School are encouraged to make an appointment to tour the school prior to submitting an application. You may contact the school at (908) 977-6640 or email info@americanmontessorischools.com to arrange a tour.</p>

<p>If you would prefer to attend an Open House, and there is an upcoming one scheduled, you may RSVP by email. The tours allow the parents an opportunity to discuss with the administrator any questions or concerns they may have.
After your tour, you may fill out an application at the school to reserve your childâ€™s spot.</p>
